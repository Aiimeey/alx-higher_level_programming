JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures
Overview

This repository contains a set of JavaScript programs that focus on understanding and implementing concepts related to objects, scopes, and closures. The tasks are designed to enhance your proficiency in JavaScript programming and cover topics such as object creation, prototypes, inheritance, and working with closures.
Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each addressing specific aspects of JavaScript programming. The tasks and their corresponding files are as follows:

    Task 0: Rectangle #0
        File: 0-rectangle.js
        Description: Defines an empty class Rectangle using the class notation.

    Task 1: Rectangle #1
        File: 1-rectangle.js
        Description: Defines a class Rectangle with a constructor that takes width (w) and height (h) as arguments.

    Task 2: Rectangle #2
        File: 2-rectangle.js
        Description: Extends the Rectangle class with additional checks to create an empty object if width or height is not a positive integer.

    Task 3: Rectangle #3
        File: 3-rectangle.js
        Description: Adds an instance method print() to the Rectangle class that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

    Task 4: Rectangle #4
        File: 4-rectangle.js
        Description: Extends the Rectangle class with instance methods rotate() and double() for rotating the rectangle and doubling its dimensions.

    Task 5: Square #0
        File: 5-square.js
        Description: Defines a class Square that inherits from the Rectangle class. The constructor takes a single argument size.

    Task 6: Square #1
        File: 6-square.js
        Description: Extends the Square class with an instance method charPrint(c) that prints the square using the character c.

    Task 7: Occurrences
        File: 7-occurrences.js
        Description: Implements a function nbOccurences(list, searchElement) that returns the number of occurrences of searchElement in the given list.

    Task 8: Esrever
        File: 8-esrever.js
        Description: Implements a function esrever(list) that returns the reversed version of the input list without using the built-in reverse method.

    Task 9: Log me
        File: 9-logme.js
        Description: Implements a function logMe(item) that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

    Task 10: Number conversion
        File: 10-converter.js
        Description: Implements a function converter(base) that returns a function to convert a number from base 10 to the specified base.
