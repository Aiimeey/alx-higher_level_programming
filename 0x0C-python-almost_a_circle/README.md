### Almost a Circle - Python OOP Project

The "Almost a Circle" project is part of the Python curriculum, designed to help you gain a strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. In this project, you'll delve into various aspects of Python programming, including classes, inheritance, exceptions, and file handling. You'll also explore advanced topics like unit testing, serialization, deserialization, and working with JSON data.
#### Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a series of Python classes that can be used to manage geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. These classes will be designed in an object-oriented manner, providing a foundation for more complex projects and real-world applications.
Learning Objectives

#### By completing this project, you will be able to:

    Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
    Implement and use classes to model objects and their behaviors.
    Work with inheritance to create hierarchies of related classes.
    Handle exceptions to ensure robust and reliable code.
    Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.
    Serialize and deserialize objects using JSON.
    Read and write data to/from JSON files.
    Create and manage named arguments in functions.

#### Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks that gradually build up the functionality of classes. The key tasks include:

    Creating a base class with the ability to assign unique IDs to instances.
    Implementing a Rectangle class that inherits from the base class and manages rectangles with attributes like width, height, x, and y.
    Validating attributes and adding methods like calculating the area and displaying the shape.
    Overloading the __str__ method to provide a user-friendly representation of the shape.
    Extending the display method to handle the position (x, y) of the shape.
    Updating instance attributes through a flexible update method.
    Creating a Square class that inherits from the Rectangle class and handles square-specific attributes.
    Implementing a method to get and set the square's size.
    Extending the update method to work with square-specific attributes.
    Converting instances to dictionaries for easy data representation.
    Writing instances to a JSON file.
    Reading instances from a JSON file.
    Providing the ability to create instances from a dictionary.
    Loading instances from a JSON file.
