## 0x05. Python - Exceptions
### Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of exceptions in Python. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. Understanding how to handle exceptions is essential for writing robust and error-tolerant code.

#### The objectives of this project :

    Understanding why Python programming is awesome.
    Differentiating between errors and exceptions.
    Learning about exceptions and how to use them.
    Knowing when to use exceptions.
    Correctly handling exceptions.
    Understanding the purpose of catching exceptions.
    Learning how to raise a built-in exception.
    Knowing when to implement a clean-up action after an exception.

#### Safe List Printing:
        Create a function to print elements from a list.
        Handle exceptions and return the count of printed elements.

#### Safe Printing of Integer Lists:
        Build a function to print integers.
        Return True if it's an integer, else return False.

#### Print and Count Integers:
        Develop a function to print and count integers in a list.
        Use try-except for error handling.

#### Integers Division with Debug:
        Implement a function to divide two integers.
        Print the result and handle exceptions.
        Include error message for division by zero.

#### Divide a List:
        Create a function for element-wise division of two lists.
        Return a new list with division results.
        Handle exceptions and print error messages.

#### Raise Exception:
        Write a function to explicitly raise a type exception using try-except.

#### Raise a Message:
        Implement a function to raise a named exception with a custom message using try-except.

#### Safe Integer Print with Error Message (Advanced):
        Create a function to print an integer and return True if it's an integer.
        Return False and print an error message with exception details if it's not an integer.

#### Safe Function (Advanced):
        Build a function to execute another function safely.
        Return the result of the executed function or None if an exception occurs.
        Print any exception details to stderr.

#### CPython #2: PyFloatObject (Advanced):
        Implement three C functions to inspect Python lists, bytes, and float objects.
        Handle Python objects and print relevant information during inspection.
        Test these functions using a provided Python script.
