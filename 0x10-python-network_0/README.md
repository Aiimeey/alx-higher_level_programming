Project 0x10 - Python Network #0
Introduction

Welcome to Project 0x10 - Python Network #0! This project, led by Guillaume, focuses on expanding your understanding of network concepts and enhancing your skills in utilizing the cURL tool for making HTTP requests. The project spans various tasks, each designed to reinforce specific learning objectives related to HTTP, URLs, request methods, and more.
Project Overview

In this project, you will be working with Bash scripts and Python to interact with web servers, utilizing cURL for making HTTP requests. The tasks range from examining response body sizes to sending custom requests with specific headers and parameters. Each script is carefully crafted to meet the outlined requirements, ensuring a deep understanding of network fundamentals and effective scripting techniques.
Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain proficiency in the following areas:

    Understanding the components of a URL
    Grasping the fundamentals of HTTP, including request and response structures
    Learning how to use cURL to make HTTP requests in a Bash environment
    Handling various HTTP methods such as GET, DELETE, and POST
    Sending custom headers and parameters in HTTP requests

Repository Structure

Each task has its corresponding Bash or Python script, adhering to specific requirements outlined in the project description. The README.md file at the root provides essential information and instructions for the project.
Tasks Overview

    cURL body size: Write a Bash script to display the size of the body of an HTTP response for a given URL using cURL.

    cURL to the end: Create a Bash script to send a GET request to a URL and display the body of the response only for a 200 status code.

    cURL Method: Implement a Bash script to send a DELETE request to a specified URL and display the body of the response.

    cURL only methods: Develop a Bash script to display all HTTP methods accepted by a server for a given URL.

    cURL headers: Write a Bash script to send a GET request to a URL with a specific header variable and display the body of the response.

    cURL POST parameters: Create a Bash script to send a POST request to a URL with specified parameters and display the body of the response.

    Find a peak: Implement a Python function to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers, ensuring optimal algorithm complexity.
