 Python - Import & Modules

This project explores various aspects of Python programming related to importing modules, using command line arguments, and working with functions from other files. The project includes several tasks, each with its own objectives and requirements. Below is a brief description of each task:
Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file

In this task, you will write a Python program that imports a function add(a, b) from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition of 1 + 2.
Task 1: My first toolbox!

Task 1 involves writing a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs various mathematical operations, and prints the results.
Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!

For this task, you will create a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists the arguments. The program should handle different numbers of arguments gracefully.
Task 3: Infinite addition

You will write a program that calculates and prints the result of adding all the arguments passed to it, including handling large numbers.
Task 4: Who are you?

Task 4 requires you to write a program that prints all the names defined in the compiled module hidden_4.pyc, excluding names that start with "__".
Task 5: Everything can be imported

You'll write a program that imports a variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
Task 6: Build my own calculator! (Advanced)

In this advanced task, you will create a calculator program that can perform basic operations (+, -, *, /) based on command line arguments.
Task 7: Easy print (Advanced)

Task 7 challenges you to write a program that prints "#pythoniscool" in the standard output in a maximum of 2 lines, without using certain Python features.
Task 8: ByteCode -> Python #3 (Advanced)

You will write a Python function magic_calculation(a, b) that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode.
Task 9: Fast alphabet (Advanced)

The final task is to create a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase in a maximum of 3 lines, without using loops, conditional statements, or certain Python features.
