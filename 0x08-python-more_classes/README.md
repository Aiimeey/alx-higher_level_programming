This repository contains a series of Python projects focused on teaching and reinforcing concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The projects cover a range of topics including class creation, attributes, methods, properties, and more.
Project List

### This project introduces the basics of classes and objects in Python.

    0. Simple Rectangle - Defines an empty class Rectangle.

    1. Real Definition of a Rectangle - Defines a class Rectangle with private instance attributes and getters/setters for width and height.

    2. Area and Perimeter - Extends the Rectangle class to include methods to calculate area and perimeter.

    3. String Representation - Adds string representations to the Rectangle class.

    4. Eval is Magic - Enhances the Rectangle class by implementing the __str__ and __repr__ methods.

    5. Detect Instance Deletion - Adds a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.

    6. How Many Instances - Tracks the number of Rectangle instances created and deleted.

    7. Change Representation - Adds a class attribute print_symbol to change the string representation.

    8. Compare Rectangles - Adds a static method to compare rectangles based on area.

    9. A Square is a Rectangle - Introduces a class method to create squares.

    10. N Queens (Advanced) - Solves the N queens puzzle by placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
