Python Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and C programs that demonstrate various concepts related to
lists and tuples in Python. These scripts are designed to help you understand and practice working with these
fundamental data structures. The tasks and topics covered in this repository include:

    1. Print a List of Integers: A Python script that prints all integers from a given list.

    2. Secure Access to an Element in a List: A Python function that retrieves an element from a list, handling negative
    indices and out-of-range scenarios.

    3. Replace Element in a List: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position,
    preserving
    the original list.

    4. Print a List of Integers in Reverse: A Python script that prints all integers from a list in reverse order.

    5. Replace in a Copy: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying
    the original list.

    6. Remove 'c' and 'C' from a String: A Python function that removes all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C'
    from
    a string.

    7. Print a Matrix of Integers: A Python function that prints a matrix of integers in a specified format.

    8. Add Two Tuples: A Python function that adds two tuples element-wise and returns a new tuple.

    9. Return Length and First Character of a String: A Python function that returns the length of a string and its
    first
    character.

    10. Find the Maximum Integer in a List: A Python function that finds the largest integer in a list.

    11. Find Multiples of 2 in a List: A Python function that identifies if each element in a list is a multiple of 2
    and returns a corresponding Boolean list.

    12. Delete an Element at a Specific Position in a List: A Python function that deletes an element at a specified
    index in a list.
    
    13. Python Value Swap : a Python script to swap the values of 'a' and 'b'.

    14. Linked List Palindrome: A C function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

    14. CPython #0: Python Lists: A C function that prints basic information about Python lists, such as size, allocated
    memory, and element types.
