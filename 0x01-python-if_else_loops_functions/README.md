### Python - if/else, loops, functions

This repository contains Python scripts for a project focusing on if/else statements, loops, and functions. It is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.
Task 0: Positive or Negative

    Create a Python program that determines if a generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

Tasks :

Task 1: The Last Digit

    Write a Python program to extract and print the last digit of a given number.

Task 2: Print the Alphabet

    Develop a Python program to print the lowercase English alphabet from 'a' to 'z'.

Task 3: Print the Alphabet Excluding 'q' and 'e'

    Extend the previous task to print the lowercase English alphabet while excluding 'q' and 'e'.

Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing

    Create a Python program to print hexadecimal values from 0 to 98.

Task 5: Print Numbers from 00 to 99

    Write a Python program to print all two-digit numbers from '00' to '99'.

Task 6: Print Combinations of Two Digits

    Generate and display all possible combinations of two-digit numbers from '00' to '99' using Python.

Task 7: Check if a Character is Lowercase

    Develop a Python program to check if a given character is a lowercase letter.

Task 8: Print a String in Uppercase

    Write a Python program to convert and print a given string in uppercase letters.

Task 9: Print the Last Digit of a Number

    Create a Python program to print the last digit of a given integer.

Task 10: Add Two Integers

    Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs, adds them, and prints the result.

Compute a to the Power of b: 
    
    Develop a Python program to calculate 'a' raised to the power of 'b'.

Fizz Buzz: 
    
    Implement a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with 'Fizz', multiples of 5 with 'Buzz', and multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'.

Insert in Sorted Linked List: 

    Create a Python function that inserts a new node into a sorted singly linked list while preserving the sorting order.
