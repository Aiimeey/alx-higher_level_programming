## Python Everything is Object

Welcome to the Python Everything is Object project! In this project, you will delve deep into the fascinating world of Python's object-oriented nature. Python is renowned for treating everything as an object, and this project aims to help you understand the intricacies of this concept.

### Project Tasks

This project consists of a series of tasks designed to reinforce your understanding of Python's object-oriented nature. Here's a list of the tasks you'll encounter:

Task 0: Identify the function used to get the type of an object.

Task 1: Find out how to get the variable identifier (memory address) in the CPython implementation.

Task 2: Determine if two variables point to the same object.

Task 3: Determine if two variables point to the same object.

Task 4: Determine if two variables point to the same object.

Task 5: Determine if two variables point to the same object.
