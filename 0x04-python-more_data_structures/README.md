### Project: 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

#### Overview

This project is a part of ALX Africa Intranet's Python curriculum and focuses on Python's data structures, specifically
sets and dictionaries. It covers a range of tasks that involve working with these data structures, manipulating them
and performing various operations.

#### Project Structure

    1. Squared Simple (Mandatory): Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

    2. Search and Replace (Mandatory): Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element with another in a 
    new list.

    3. Unique Addition (Mandatory): Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (each integer only once).

    4. Present in Both (Mandatory): Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

    5. Only Differents (Mandatory): Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

    6. Number of Keys (Mandatory): Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

    7. Print Sorted Dictionary (Mandatory): Write a function that prints a dictionary with keys sorted in alphabetical 
    order.

    8. Update Dictionary (Mandatory): Write a function that replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.

    9. Simple Delete by Key (Mandatory): Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

    10. Multiply by 2 (Mandatory): Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

    11. Best Score (Mandatory): Write a function that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.

    12. Roman to Integer (Mandatory): Write a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

    13. Weighted Average (Advanced): Write a function that returns the weighted average of integers in a list of tuples.

    14. Squared by Using Map (Advanced): Write a function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix 
    using map.

    15. Delete by Value (Advanced): Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

    16. CPython #1: PyBytesObject (Advanced): Implement C functions for printing information about Python lists and 
    bytes objects.
