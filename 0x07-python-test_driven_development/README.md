## Python Test-Driven Development Project
### Introduction

Welcome to the Python Test-Driven Development Project! In this project, you'll be tackling a series of programming tasks that will not only sharpen your Python coding skills but also emphasize the importance of test-driven development (TDD). Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with Python, this project offers a comprehensive range of challenges designed to enhance your Python expertise.

    Integers addition:
        Write a function that adds two integers.
        Handle cases where the input is not an integer or float.

    Divide a matrix:
        Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.
        Handle various input validation conditions.

    Say my name:
        Write a function that prints a given name.
        Handle cases where the input is not a string.

    Print square:
        Write a function that prints a square of a specified size.
        Handle cases where the input is not an integer or is negative.

    Text indentation:
        Write a function that adds two newlines after each '.', '?', and ':' in a text.
        Handle cases where the input is not a string.

    Max integer - Unittest:
        Write unit tests for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list.
        Ensure that the tests cover various scenarios.

    Matrix multiplication:
        Write a function to multiply two matrices.
        Implement extensive input validation to ensure the matrices can be multiplied.

    Lazy matrix multiplication:
        Write a function that multiplies two matrices using NumPy.
        Test the function similarly to the previous matrix multiplication task.

    CPython #3: Python Strings:
        Create a CPython extension that prints information about Python strings.
        Handle cases where the input is not a valid string.
